# INTEGRATIONS.md — the integration landscape & consumer's position

## The landscape (verified 2026-10-06)

| Platform | Model | Credential custody | Our read |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Composio** | 1,000+ connectors, managed OAuth + tool execution for agents | **Composio-managed** (cloud) | The action-infra leader — but closed, and its 2025 breach (≈5,001 GitHub OAuth tokens + 5,241 API keys exposed via an intercepted employee Gmail OAuth token) is the exact failure mode local credential custody exists to prevent |
| **Nango** | open-source OAuth infra, 400+ prebuilt provider configs, self-host | **You own** (your instance, your DB) | The only platform matching our philosophy — open, self-hostable, credentials never leave your box |
| **Merge.dev** | unified API per category (HR/payroll/etc.) | Merge-managed | Category-normalization play; different problem than ours |
| **Pipedream** | 3,000+ APIs, managed auth, event triggers | Pipedream-managed | Excellent action/event infra; cloud custody again |
| **Ampersand** | real-time native integrations | Ampersand-managed | Write-path infra |

## Our lane vs theirs

- **Their lane: ACTION** — an agent *does* things in apps (send email, create
  ticket, post message). Tool-calling infrastructure.
- **Our lane: CONSUMPTION** — archives flow *in* and become a queryable,
  attributed knowledge graph. Assimilation infrastructure.

The only overlap is OAuth plumbing — and that we adopt rather than rebuild.

## The consumer's connector architecture (three auth lanes)

1. **Local (default, zero-dependency)**: `creds.py` (segmented store,
   Muse-pattern broker) + `ortie` OAuth tokens + keychain/env passwords.
   Works offline, nothing leaves the box. Verified live: gmail via ortie.
2. **Nango (optional, 400+ apps)**: if you run Nango (self-hosted, open
   source), the consumer mints tokens through YOUR instance — `--auth nango`.
   You get Nango's prebuilt OAuth configs without custody loss: tokens live
   in your Nango, the consumer fetches them at call time, never stores.
3. **Manual (escape hatch)**: any app's export (zip of Notion pages, Slack
   export, Takeout) — `source.py` consumes it with zero auth plumbing.

## Why local-first remains the default

The Composio breach is the case study: cloud-held agent credentials become a
single high-value target (their sandbox + credential cache behind one
phished employee token). The consumer's law: credentials stay in
per-platform segmented stores, brokers attach them at the network boundary,
manifests record identity only. For the apps that matter most to you, that
law is not negotiable — which is why it's the default lane and Nango is the
opt-in for the long tail.

## Adding a connector (contributor guide)

A connector = (1) auth lane, (2) export function that writes text files +
an `acquisition.json` manifest with attribution, (3) feed through
`ingest.py` → `graph.py`. That's it — the rest of the engine is shared.
See `connectors.py` (gmail/imap) for the shape.
