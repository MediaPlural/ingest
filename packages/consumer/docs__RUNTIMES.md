# RUNTIMES.md — one engine, every runtime

The consumer is CLI-first: the engine is its commands. Skills, rules, and MCP
servers are thin adapters that tell each runtime how to invoke the same CLI.

| Runtime | Adapter shape | Install target |
|---|---|---|
| Hermes | AgentSkills SKILL.md | `~/.hermes/skills/consumer` |
| Claude Code | AgentSkills SKILL.md (+ `/consumer` slash command) | `~/.claude/skills/consumer` |
| OpenClaw | AgentSkills SKILL.md (user-invocable slash command) | `~/.openclaw/skills/consumer` |
| Cursor | SKILL.md (project or user store) + `.mdc` rule | `.cursor/skills/consumer` + `.cursor/rules/consumer.mdc` |
| VS Code/Copilot | MCP server + rule | `.vscode/mcp.json` + user settings |
| Any MCP client | stdio server `mcp-server.py` (5 tools) | client's MCP config |

## Install / refresh all runtimes

```bash
bash install-everywhere.sh            # all runtimes, detected presence
bash install-everywhere.sh --vscode-code "Code"   # VS Code variant on macOS
```

The installer detects which runtimes are present and installs/refreshes
adapters for exactly those, writing a per-run report. OpenClaw is not yet
installed on studio; when it lands, `install-everywhere.sh` picks it up.

## Remote/agent invocation

Any remote agent (Viiy squad, Brandon's stack) can use the engine via:
1. The MCP stdio server: `python3 mcp-server.py` (tools: source, transcribe,
   scrape, distill, graph_query; graph db via CONSUMER_GRAPH_DB env)
2. The HTTP API: `api.py` (8 routes; /search /semantic /hybrid /filter
   /insight /maths /export /status + POST /ingest; env CONSUMER_GRAPH_DB selects db)
3. Direct CLI over ssh (umbra: `~/consumer`)

## Laws (apply to every runtime adapter)

- Credentials: segmented store `~/.consumer/creds/<platform>/` (Muse pattern,
  Broker-only) or keychain; never in code, argv, or logs.
- Attribution inbuilt: url + credential-identity + timestamp everywhere.
- SAFE runner for bank actions: shlex-quote, argv, no shell=True.
- No DRM/paywall breaking; owned/licensed material only.
